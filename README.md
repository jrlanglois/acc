# jrl_acc

**jrl_ACC is** an ACS script compiler for use with [ZDoom](http://zdoom.org/News) and [Hexen](http://doom.wikia.com/wiki/Hexen).

It is based on the original [acc](https://github.com/rheit/acc) repository,
but uses [JUCE](https://github.com/julianstorer/JUCE) for a modern approach to its code.

You will find a code editor and script compiler packaged within this repository.
