# jrl_acc

**jrl_acc** is an ACS script compiler, for use in tandem with [ZDoom](http://zdoom.org/News) and [Hexen](http://doom.wikia.com/wiki/Hexen).

It is based on the original [acc](https://github.com/rheit/acc) repository,
but is redesigned in C++ using [JUCE](https://github.com/julianstorer/JUCE) for a modern approach to its code.

# New Features

* Unity build module that can be easily brought into any existing JUCE project.
* Lightning fast compile times.
* Code editor.
* Code tokeniser and syntax highlighter.
